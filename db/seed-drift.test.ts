 * `db/seed.sql` and `src/data/demo.ts` describe the same fiction (§5.2 item 3).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────
 * §5.2 item 3 asks for maker-shop's `db/generate-seed.mjs` here, which WRITES
 * the SQL from the TypeScript so the two cannot differ in any value. That
 * script is 372 lines of one studio's domain arithmetic, so porting it is a
 * bespoke generator per repo rather than a copy, and it is not funded yet.
 *
 * This is the cheap half, and it catches the drift that actually happens: a row
 * added to one side and not the other. It compares COUNTS — nothing here says
 * the values agree. Read that limitation as stated, not as covered.
 *
 * The counter is `db/seed-rows.mjs`, byte-identical in every repo; edit
 * `workplan/tools/seed-drift/` and re-run its `apply`, never this copy.
