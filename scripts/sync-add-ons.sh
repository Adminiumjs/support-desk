# sync-add-ons.sh — vendor the add-on client halves into this app, and prove the
# copies have not drifted from the repository they came from.
#
# THIS SCRIPT SHIPS IN THIS REPO, and that is the whole reason it exists here.
# The anti-drift check used to live only in the author's local workplan tree,
# which is gitignored: `src/add-ons/registry.ts` told a reader to "re-run the
# sync script", CI had no script to run, and a cloner could not have run one if
# they had wanted to. A gate nobody but one laptop can execute is not a gate.
#
# ── WHAT THIS STOREFRONT VENDORS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ─────────────────────
#
# Two targets, not four. The print works and the maker studio each host every
# slot in the registry and vendor three add-ons between them; this app declares
# only a CUSTOMER frontend in `manifest.json`, so it hosts the two customer
# surfaces plus the settings panel and vendors the one add-on that fills them.
# Widening the list is a decision about what a shopper downloads, which is why
# it is a list here rather than a glob over the monorepo.
#
# ── ONE SOURCE REPOSITORY, NOT THREE ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The add-ons used to be three standalone repositories and this script pulled
# from three sibling checkouts. They are ONE monorepo now, and the reason is the
# same reason this script exists: each of the three carried its own copy of the
# host contract, and within a day the copies disagreed — the `AddOn` interface
# had 19 members in one, 18 in another, 18 in the third, and two members the
# host declares (`nameKey`, `inDemo`) in none of them. Nothing failed and
# nothing could have, because no suite anywhere had two copies in front of it.
#
#   <somewhere>/ecommerce-storefront  ← this repo, the HOST
#   <somewhere>/add-ons         ← the monorepo
#       packages/host/              the ONE shared contract
#       packages/design-studio/
#       packages/shipping-dhl/
#       packages/import-canva/
#
# Override with ADD_ONS_DIR=/path/to/add-ons if yours lives elsewhere. NOTE the
# changed meaning: it used to name the directory CONTAINING three checkouts, and
# it now names the monorepo checkout itself. A stale value is caught below and
# reported as such rather than as a missing file.
#
# ── WHAT THE HOST VENDORS, AND WHY `vendor/host/` EXISTS ────────────────────
#
#   src/add-ons/vendor/host/<file>   from add-ons/packages/host/src/<file>
#   src/add-ons/vendor/<key>/<file>  from add-ons/packages/<key>/src/<file>
#
# The add-on sources import their shared contract as `@adminium/add-on-host`.
# This app has no node_modules for that package and never will: it is a static
# Vite SPA published standalone to the Adminiumjs org, built from a clean clone
# with no sibling checkout of anything. So the shared package is VENDORED TOO,
# once, into `vendor/host/`, and the copied files' imports are rewritten to
# reach it by relative path (see REWRITES below). The vendored tree is then
# self-contained: it compiles with nothing beside it.
#
# AND THIS REPO KEEPS NO SECOND DECLARATION OF `AddOn`, which is where it
# departs from the two hosts that had the seam first. Both of those carry their
# own `src/add-ons/host.ts` beside the vendored copy, and the monorepo's
# `host-mirror.test.ts` reads those two files by name and fails when they drift
# from the package. That arrangement earns its keep in a host that helped design
# the contract and can therefore be AHEAD of it; a retrofit is behind it by
# definition, and a hand-written mirror here would be a second copy of 700 lines
# with nothing on the far side reading it — the exact defect the monorepo was
# consolidated to end ("19 members in one, 18 in another"). So this app imports
# the vendored contract directly, `vendor/host/` is the only declaration, and
# `npx tsc -b` compares what the add-on returns with what this app mounts
# through the payload generic instead of through a duplicated interface.
#
# THE MONOREPO IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Edit it, then re-run `sync` here. A
# hand-edit under vendor/ is invisible until it is a bug in two places at once,
# which is exactly what `status` is for.
#
# Every vendored file carries a header naming its source and saying it is synced
# rather than hand-edited. `status` strips that header back off, and applies the
# same import rewrite to the source, before comparing — so neither the header
# nor the rewrite is itself a source of drift.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED, and none of it is an oversight:
#   *.test.ts(x)   the monorepo runs its own suites; re-running them here would
#                  assert the copy rather than the thing (and the conformance
#                  suites pull in zod, which the host does not carry — 24 D7).
#   src/testing/   the copied conformance harness and build helpers, same
#                  reason. The shared package's `testing/` entry point — where
#                  its zod validators live — is never vendored either.
#   slots.ts       each package's `FILLED_SLOTS` is read only by its own
#                  manifest suite. This app has its own `src/add-ons/slots.ts`,
#                  which is the authoritative list of what it hosts — and it is
#                  a STRICT SUBSET of the registry, asserted by the kit's mounts
#                  guard, because this app hosts three of the twelve.
#   src/carrier.ts src/http.ts src/server.ts src/server/artwork-source.ts
#                  the SERVER halves. Secrets are server-only (24 D15) and the
#                  client bundle must not be able to reach the module that holds
#                  them. `status` fails if one ever appears under vendor/.
#   vite-env.d.ts  ambient Vite types the host already has.
#
# With no monorepo checkout present, `status` reports SOURCE-MISSING and exits 0
# — a clean clone of this app alone still builds, and its own suites still
# assert what is vendored. `sync` in that situation is an error, because there
# is nothing to sync FROM.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sync-add-ons.sh status   what is vendored, and whether it matches
#   scripts/sync-add-ons.sh sync     re-copy from the monorepo
#   scripts/sync-add-ons.sh list     the file list each package contributes
