/**
 * DID THE FILL ACTUALLY DRAW ANYTHING? — the question `:empty` only half asks.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT, AT ITS THIRD DEPTH ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * [Added 2026-08-11, wave 4b round 6. Mirrored byte for byte into both hosts as
 * `src/add-ons/slotContent.ts`. Moved into the kit 2026-08-28, 31-T04, with
 * nothing but this paragraph changed — it is the ONE file of the seam that never
 * drifted, and `diff print-shop maker-shop` on it was empty on the day it was
 * lifted. That is not luck: it is the only module in the seam carrying no host
 * token at all — no class prefix, no store import, no slot union — which is
 * exactly the property the rest of the kit had to be given by hand. A reader
 * wondering why the other files needed a config and this one did not has the
 * answer in that sentence.]
 *
 * A host surface renders every fill, then renders its OWN content after them,
 * and one sibling rule decides which the reader sees:
 *
 *     .slot-spare { display: contents }
 *     .slot-fill:not(:empty) ~ .slot-spare { display: none }
 *
 * Round 2 wrote that to close a real defect: an add-on may register a fill and
 * correctly draw nothing for a particular record, and the version that hid the
 * host's fallback whenever a fill EXISTED meant connecting an add-on took a
 * picture away. Round 5 ported it to the second host. Round 6 is the same
 * defect one level deeper:
 *
 *   `:empty` IS NOT "DREW NOTHING". It is "has no child nodes". A fill that
 *   returns `null` is empty and the rule works. A fill that returns a bare
 *   `<div/>`, or a wrapper whose only child is `display: none`, is NOT empty —
 *   so the host's fallback is suppressed by a fill that painted nothing, and
 *   the reader gets a blank box exactly where the picture used to be.
 *
 * The old comment in `AddOnSlot` said "no JavaScript can ask this question and
 * CSS can". Half of that was right: JavaScript cannot ask it AT RENDER TIME,
 * before the fill has run. It can ask it afterwards, of the DOM, which is what
 * this file does — and CSS cannot ask it at all, because `:empty` is a question
 * about child nodes and this is a question about paint.
 *
 * ── THE RULE, IN ONE SENTENCE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An element DREW when it holds non-whitespace text, or is an element that
 * paints on its own (an image, a canvas, a control), or the browser gives it a
 * box of its own — a background, a border, a shadow, generated content — or any
 * descendant does; and NOTHING that is `hidden`, `display: none` or
 * `visibility: hidden` counts, however much is inside it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED ───────────────────────
 *
 * It reads `getComputedStyle`, so in a browser it sees what a class did; under
 * jsdom with no stylesheet loaded it sees only inline styles — and that is the
 * SAME answer, not a weaker one, because a class with no stylesheet behind it
 * paints nothing there either.
 *
 * What it genuinely cannot see:
 *
 *   PAINT THAT BELONGS TO AN ANCESTOR. A fill drawing into a parent's
 *   background, or positioned outside its own subtree, reads as nothing.
 *   Nothing in these apps does that.
 *
 *   A ZERO-SIZED BOX WITH A BACKGROUND. `background` is taken as evidence of
 *   drawing without measuring whether the box has any area, deliberately: the
 *   alternative is a layout read, and a layout read returns zero for everything
 *   under jsdom, which would make the tested behaviour and the shipped
 *   behaviour two different behaviours.
 *
 * WHEN IN DOUBT IT SAYS "DREW", which is exactly what the app did before this
 * file existed. Every case it is unsure about therefore behaves as it always
 * has, and the only behaviour that changes is the one that was wrong.
