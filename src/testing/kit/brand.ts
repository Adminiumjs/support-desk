/**
 * THE HOST NAMES NO COMPANY — and the one line shape that is allowed to.
 *
 * ── WHY THE CRITERION'S OWN GREP PROVED NOTHING ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * 24 AC5 says nothing in the host app names a carrier, and the grep the
 * criterion prescribes is "dhl". That is exactly the name the print works did
 * NOT contain, so the criterion passed and proved nothing. What the works DID
 * contain, until a suite of this shape existed, was
 *
 *     name: 'Royal Mail Shipping',
 *     name: 'Stripe Payments',
 *     name: 'Mailchimp Lists',
 *
 * in its add-on registry: three real firms named in host source, for
 * integrations that do not exist. They are descriptions now.
 *
 * So the grep is widened to the firms a shop would plausibly reach for, and
 * pointed at PRODUCTION SOURCE OUTSIDE THE VENDOR DIRECTORY. The vendored
 * halves are the add-ons themselves; they name their own companies
 * nominatively, with a `TRADEMARKS.md` beside the claim in their own repos, and
 * a host that lint-banned them would be banning the add-on rather than the
 * defect.
 *
 * ── ONE ALLOWED LINE, AND IT IS A SHAPE RATHER THAN A PLACE ─────────────────
 *
 * A host has to import the add-on bundles it vendors, and the import path
 * necessarily carries the add-on key, which necessarily carries the company
 * name — `./vendor/shipping-dhl/index.ts`. That is a PATH, not a display
 * string, and it is the only thing forgiven.
 *
 * It is forgiven as a line SHAPE and not as a file: exempting `registry.ts`
 * would forgive `const carrier = 'DHL';` two lines below the import, in the one
 * file most likely to hold it. The shape is anchored on both ends, the
 * specifier must be RELATIVE (a bare package specifier is a different thing and
 * a different rule), and it must end in `index.ts` — a company name reaching
 * any deeper into an add-on is a host reading into an add-on's internals, which
 * is its own defect.
 *
 * ── AND THE SECOND RULE THIS FILE IS PROMISED TO CARRY ──────────────────────
 *
 * `config.ts`'s `INSTALL_LAYOUT` says the guard half "must never ship", and
 * names this guard as the thing that enforces it. It is here rather than in
 * `vendored.ts` because it is the same shape of question — a grep over shipped
 * sources for a spelling that must not appear — and because the consequence is
 * the same kind of thing: `guards/lexicon.ts` SPELLS EVERY BANNED WORD, so a
 * screen that imported it would put the whole word list one ordinary import
 * away from a bundle and turn a red test into a red RELEASE.
 *
 * `zod` rides along for the reason the repo it came from gives: the vendored
 * manifest validator imports it, it is a devDependency, and it is a runtime
 * dependency the host does not carry (24 D7). Both are reachable only by an
 * import from a screen, which is what this looks for.

/**
 * THE FIRMS A SHOP WOULD PLAUSIBLY REACH FOR.
 *
 * Word-anchored, and here the anchor is right — unlike the vocabulary ban,
 * where 17 §2's own grep is a substring run and an anchored copy would be
 * strictly weaker than the gate it stands for. This rule has no gate behind it
 * to be weaker than; what it has is a shop that says "ups" inside "groups" and
 * "dpd" inside nothing at all. `\b` is what keeps the report readable, and a
 * report nobody skims is the only kind that gets acted on.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A COMPLETE LIST OF COMPANIES AND CANNOT BE. Naming every firm on
 * earth is the `ONE_SHOP_WORDS` problem again: the honest statement is that
 * this catches the ones a shop actually reaches for, that a reviewer still has
 * to read a diff, and that the twelve here are the twelve that have actually
 * turned up in a host's source or in a design comp.
 *
 * A HOST MAY NOT ADD TO IT, for `config.ts`'s reason: an add-on that named a
 * thirteenth firm would then pass in the host that had heard of it and fail in
 * the one that had not, which is 24 D21 broken by a route nobody looks down.
 * A thirteenth firm belongs here, where all twelve hosts get it.
 *
 * ── AND ONE TOKEN GETS A NARROWER BOUNDARY THAN `\b` ───────────────────────
 *
 * Found by the fifth consumer (31-T07): its seeded status history says a bad
 * deploy "rejected fresh sign-ups", and `\bups\b` matched it — a hyphen is a
 * word boundary to a regex and the middle of a word to English, so every
 * hyphenated compound ending in "-ups" (sign-ups, follow-ups, mock-ups,
 * pick-ups) read as the parcel company. The exclusion is scoped to that ONE
 * token rather than applied to the list: a hyphen before `dhl` is not English
 * at all — it is `shipping-dhl` in a path, which is precisely a mention this
 * gate must go on refusing outside the one allowed line. So `ups` alone
 * refuses a letter-hyphen prefix, "UPS" on its own still bites, and the
 * self-test holds all three directions.

 * The one line a host source may hold a company name on: the vendored import.
 *
 * Derived from `config.vendorDir` rather than written out, because the leaf
 * name is a host's own business and a hard-coded `vendor/` would silently stop
 * forgiving anything in a host that called it something else — the failure
 * being a red suite on correct code, which is how a gate earns an exemption.
 *
 * ── BOTH QUOTE STYLES, AND THE FIRST RETROFIT IS WHY ───────────────────────
 *
 * This pattern reads a HOST's source, and a host's quote style is the host's.
 * The kit's own sources are single-quoted and never hand-edited, which settles
 * the question for everything in `src/add-ons/kit/` and settles nothing here:
 * `factory-ops` is double-quoted throughout, wrote the one allowed line in its
 * own style, and this gate reported its registry as naming a company — a red
 * suite on the exact line the rule exists to permit. A gate that is red on
 * correct code is a gate somebody exempts a file for, and an exemption in
 * `registry.ts` would forgive every other line in the file that names one.
 *
 * The two spellings are alternated rather than written as a character class,
 * so an opening `'` closed by a `"` is still refused. That is not fussiness
 * about a case nobody writes — it is the difference between a pattern that
 * describes a line and one that merely accepts it.

/**
 * TWO PIECES OF A SPECIFIER, KEPT APART SO THE INSTALL CANNOT EDIT A FIXTURE.
 *
 * `install-host-kit.sh` rewrites import specifiers on the way into a host: a
 * literal `'../../add-ons/vendor/host/index.ts'` becomes the vendored path, and a literal
 * `'../../add-ons/kit/x` becomes `'../../add-ons/kit/x`. That is correct for the imports at
 * the top of these files and WRONG for the strings a guard feeds itself, which
 * are fixtures rather than imports — and `sed` cannot tell the two apart.
 *
 * It had already happened, in two of these files, before anybody looked. In
 * `vendored.ts` the rewrite turned a bare-specifier fixture into a relative
 * path and the self-test failed on the FIRST retrofit that ran it — which was
 * the lucky half. In this file it rewrote two paths that still happened to
 * satisfy their assertions, so both cases went on passing while no longer
 * asking what they were written to ask. A guard whose own fixture has been
 * quietly edited is the exact shape of blindness this package exists to end.
 *
 * Splitting the literal defeats the rewrite because the rewrite matches a
 * QUOTED WHOLE — `'../../add-ons/vendor/host/index.ts'` including both quotes, and `'..`
 * immediately after an opening quote. Neither half below is either of those.
 * `files.test.ts` already builds its comment-token fixtures the same way, for
